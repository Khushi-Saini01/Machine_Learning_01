I’m a B.E. CSE (AI & ML) student at Chandigarh University.
Passionate about Machine Learning and building cool projects.
This is one of my beginner-level ML projects to learn and showcase skills.
# Study Hours vs Exam Scores – Machine Learning Project
Hi there! 
This project is a simple machine learning web app that predicts a student’s exam score based on how many hours they studied. I used **Linear Regression** to train the model and **Streamlit** to create the interactive web app.

## Project Idea
We always hear "Study more to score more!" — so I decided to check if there's a pattern in the data. Using a dataset of students’ study hours and their corresponding scores, I built a model to predict scores from study hours.

##  What's Included in This Project
- 'hours_vs_scores_100.csv': The dataset with 100 records.
- 'app.py': Streamlit app that includes everything — data preview, EDA, visualization, model training, and predictions.
- 'streamlit.pdf_images': Screenshots of the web app and output visuals.
- 'Linear_Regression.py': Contains only the model code for separate testing or learning.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Streamlit (to make the app)

## Key Features
- Interactive scatter plot and regression line
- Boxplot & distribution of study hours
- Dataset preview with stats and info
- Real-time prediction using a slider input
- Evaluation metrics like MSE, MAE, and R² score

## How to Run the App Locally

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Machine_Learning_01.git
